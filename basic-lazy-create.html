<!--
Lazily creates component instances for each of its children.

NOTE: This component is currently just an experiment. The goal is try to create
a way to deliver better page load performance on polyfilled browsers for pages
with long lists of components. Rather than upgrade those components on page
load, the goal of this component is to defer upgrade of its children until after
the overall page has had a chance to render. Unfortunately, the current approach
is too slow, and for polyfilled browsers is worse than letting upgrade happen
automatically.
